 ##What my project needs to do<br>
 This project needs to result in a **random message** being presented every time a user runs a program. <br>
 It **must** contain 3 different pieces of data! <br>
 I have started by creating a .JS file to create my code.<br>
 I broke the 3 pieces of data required down into singles. I chose **A greeting**, **A question** and an **Observation**.<br>
 <br>
 When running the code, it should console.log a message which has 3 sections and will be random every time.
